## Usage

Below are my recommended settings. While there's a lot of settings that are up to your choice, if you want your client to look like in the screenshots, you're gonna have to use **Game Logos**.

## Editing controller and user image
To change the controller displayed at theb bottom left, or the user image on the top left, head to SwitchNite's install folder (by default ``C:\Users\{username}\AppData\Roaming\Playnite\Themes\Fullscreen\SwitchNite_somenumbers`` and follow the instructions in the `.png` file.
